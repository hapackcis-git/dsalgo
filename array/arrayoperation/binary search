Binary search is a searching algorithm for finding
an element's position in a sorted array.
In this approach,the element is always searched in the middle of a 
portion of an array.

#Binary search can be implemented only on a sorted list of items.If the elements are not sorted already,we need to sort 
them first.


#Binary search working
Binary search algorithm cna be implemented two ways which are discused below:
1.Iterative Method
2.Recursive Method
The recursive method follows the divide and conquer approach.
The general steps for both methods are dscussed below.
1.The array in which searching is to be performed is:
Let x=4 be the element to be searched.
2.Set two pointers low and high at lowest and the highest positions respectively.
3.Find the middle of the array i.e (arr[low+high]/2)=6
4.If x==mid,then return mid.Else,compare the element to be searched wiht m.
5.If X>mid,compare x with the middle element of the elements on the right side of mid.This is done by setting low to low=mid+1,
6.Else,compare x with the middle element of the elements on the left side of mid.This is done by setting high to high=mid-1.
7.Repeat steps 3 to 6 until low meets high.
8.x=4 is found.
